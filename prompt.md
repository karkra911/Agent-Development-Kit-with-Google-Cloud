 I want to build a multi-agent data analysis system using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) with Google Cloud integration (BigQuery, Pub/Sub, etc.). Please help me design the folder structure, create initial agent files, and guide me step-by-step from scratch.



 Data Analysis and Insights: Create multi-agent systems that autonomously analyze data from various sources, derive meaningful insights using tools like BigQuery, and collaboratively present findings.
